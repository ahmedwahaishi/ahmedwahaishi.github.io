     <p>First of all, let me introduce myself, I am Ahmed Al-Wahaishi, 41 years old, I was born in Aden (Yemen).

This master degree is my dream to extend my value worldwide to get better chances, bigger companies, more promotions, higher salaries, upper IT management positions, and open the doors to work with the global famous companies in addition to expand my chances to PhD road and academic career.
